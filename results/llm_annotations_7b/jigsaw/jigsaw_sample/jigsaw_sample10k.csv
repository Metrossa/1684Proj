"Woods is doing what VJ asks him to do.  As a defensive coordinator, VJ played a lot of zone last year in Miami.  VJ learned under Marvin Lewis - that defense also plays a lot of zone and rarely blitzes.  Same philosophy now in Denver.  Wade used to bring the blitz (like he is doing with the Rams).  This team rarely blitzes and likes to play man.  That culture comes from up top and VJ.

VJ thought that playing both zone and man would make the defense unpredictable and better prepare the defense for the playoffs.  This team is not going to sniff the playoffs in a weak AFC.  The defense plain quit yesterday.  Maybe the change to Brock took the heart out of the team.  Either way, the fault lies with VJ.",0

I agree with you about the Giants defense. They were playing hard and in position to make good hard tackles on the running backs. But I can't really say they shut down the run. I'd say that was Joseph's doing by allowing McCoy to call 50 or whatever number of pass plays. There were some comments made earlier this morning about CJ and the Bronco linemen getting into a rhythm with coaches making changes to the blocking schemes to counter the defensive moves. We never saw any of that in my opinion. Big mistake and a real waste of talent by making the decision to feature Siemian trying to pass his way out of his funk. When CJ gets over 20 carries their odds to win increase too. Add Charles with his talent and then add Booker I think the Giants defenders would be the ones hurting. Why is McCoy continually putting the ball in Siemian's hand so much? I guess maybe Joseph feels he needs more game time practice so they can video tape all the plays he's blowing. Siemian's talent is play action.,0

It isn't hyperbole. The default state is liberty. The burden is on those who -support- registries (of any kind), which unarguably consume public monies, take up valuable and limited law enforcement resources and time, and put the personal information of innocent people at risk of exposure or misuse (which sets aside arguments over the infringements on the peaceable exercise of fundamental rights uniformly involved), to produce evidence to support their claims about the countervailing benefits of such registries.

Certainly Bloomberg et al would be trotting out such evidence if it existed. Fact is, Maryland eliminated its ballistic registry as a waste of time and money, Canada repealed its long gun registry as a waste of time and money (and the RCMP confirmed the handgun registry hadn't proven a useful law enforcement tool).

Artificially higher wages force them to cut back on the number of employees they pay and/or the hours they work, raise prices if the market will bear it, or go belly up.

Look at Seattle. After they passed the higher minimum wage, many small businesses closed. Jobs were lost. Those who who worked for those businesses and expected to make more money, ended up making none. The number of workers fell, the number of hours of most employees fell. Few people benefited.

1st. CO2 levels have been rising sharply ever since the industrial revolution, when we started releasing massive amounts of stored carbon. This graph shows what that looks like. Note the sharp spike on the right hand side:

Well he's avoided two for sure, and you should be thankful for that.  The first is a no-fly zone in Syria which his opponent said was her ""number one priority"" just 1 week before the election.  For those of you who don't know, a ""no fly zone"" simply means she wanted to shoot down Russian airplanes.  We have no known examples of a no-fly zone not leading to war.  There are none in history that we can look at.  Every single no-fly zone in history has lead to war.  So Trump avoided a pointless war in Syria that almost certainly would not have accomplished anything substantive (much like the Rape of Libya, another one of Hillary's blunders).  

Secondly, he's avoided conflict with Russia.  Though the establishment elites desperately want to box him in on this issue (we just sent troops to Poland), Trump genuinely desires peace and cooperation with Russia, which makes the Military-Industrial Complex furious.",0

"“which the Kremlin actively supports”

I agree the re-emergence of the far-right is a menace few gave acknowledged until the election of Trump, but to lay this at the feet of Russia? 

That’s ludicrous.

The far-right worldwide was initially emboldened by Bush/PNAC, and fed on the lies and hate it disseminated in order to enable its wanton aggression throughout the ME. 

As part of its campaign to undermine Russia (and China) as US/EU power wanes – largely due to the same factors listed above – the US has backed far-right regimes, most notably the one it installed in Ukraine, as well as far-right paramilitaries, including Neo-Nazis, which it used to oust the country’s democratically-elected government, then when much of the country’s military defected, to wage war on the Ukrainians opposed to what’s happened since the coup.

Shamefully, we've been training people to fight alongside.

In fact, the US has always backed and installed far-right regimes in order to dominate foreign states.",0

The longer the time wherein church leadership refuses to accept accountability, the harder it will be for church leaders to be  real parts of those healing circles.  It wasn't the victims who reduced the scandal to courtrooms, briefs and motions.

2.  There are too-many ""right-on-green-only lights.  Because of these, people sit at controlled intersections twice as long.  Many times, cars are waiting to turn left, and there isn't a car in sight approaching.

Get into the 80%er's, and the ratio would be lowered to about 8 to 1 or so. Get down further into the 70's, and the ratio would be 1:2 or more in favour of the kids with names signifying European ancestry.

"You're the one spewing nonsense. You've conveniently ignored the fact that 75 percent of the businesses in Calgary are facing property tax increases this year - some over 30 percent - and that non-residential property taxes in Calgary have increased by over 200 percent since Nenshi was first elected. You've also conveniently ignored the Notley government's steady increase in the minimum wage - another dollar per hour in 2016, and headed for $15/hr. by 2018 - and their introduction of a carbon tax, which will also increase. All in addition to significant income tax increases at the Federal and Provincial levels by the Trudeau and Notley governments, all during the worst economic downturn since the 1980s.

When the economy turns down in a sustained and severe manner, and governments at all levels significantly increase the cost of doing business through increased taxes and other policies, many more businesses will fail.  That's it.

Nascent democracies look to established democracies for guidance, and we tell them a free press and free and fair elections is all that is necessary.

"Most of what passes for ""Country Music"" out of the Nashville machine today is really just pop and rock music with a pedal steel thrown in, sung by somebody who needs to wear a stetson, a big belt buckle and a pair of boots to bolster his cred.

The Nashville labels have a studio of songwriters who churn out most of this plastic dross, producers who can replicate the sound while not in the room and pretty boy singers who are interchangeable.

Austin is the crucible of the Real Deal Country and Western music and more good music is coming out of Austin, and other none-Nashville locales, than ever before.

Americana/Outlaw music is where the soul of country music now resides, not on ""country radio"" and not on the major labels.

""Medical  ethics"" have nothing to do with approval by local officials of the concentration level of an existing mineral in drinking water supplies.   Anyone who does not like the content of any particular water supply is entirely free to obtain their water from another source with a content more to their personal preference.  If your tap water was laced with a high level of cyanide would you drink it simply because it flows from your faucet?  No, of course not.  You would drink bottled water, rain water, water from rivers and streams, or wherever else you could obtain it.  You would not believe you are forced to drink cyanide laced water simply because it flows from your faucet.  The same is true for anyone with an objection to fluoride in their water.

Inconvenience, regardless the degree, does not equate with force, and because you pay a local water bill does not give you the right to water with a content customized to your personal preference.

Actually, I have to admit I borrowed the 'greasy fingered' line from one of your posts. 

I never got into industry until my mid 30s.  I wanted to be an accountant until I realized I needed college/university to make any real money (CGA/CFA) at it and that wasn't happening as I grew up in a poor family.  A friend got me a job 'in the patch' and by 40 I had my first trade. (Industrial Instrument Mechanic or Instrument Tech if you prefer) I am now also a Steamfitter/Pipefitter and a Gasfitter.  I doubt that I will ever make 'consultant' though. I'm just not the type.  I will literally be the guy 'in the trenches' until I walk away. 

I never started making the big coin until around 40 when I got my first red seal.  I won't amass as much money as some, but I'll do OK.

Before long it'll be the United States against the rest of the world.  No wonder Trump (& Bannon) want to dump our fortune into military buildup. No one wins in this scenario except arms manufacturers. 

Up until now Trump has just been an entertaining trainwreck.  Comparisons to totalitarianism was just hyperbole.  No longer.  It's becoming clear what a threat he really is.  Is congress going to stand by and enable his destruction of our alliances and world peace?  Certainly Sullivan will.  Probably Young.  Murkowski?

Having had a similar situation, and if the will said cottage to be divided in 3, my solution would be to give each a third of the cottage, that comes with a third of maintenance costs.

They do very poorly in school and in life if they miss the important developmental tasks in their early years. For them it's a basic need.

"An important article about racial hate crimes in Hawaii appeared in the Fall 2009 Southern Poverty Law Center  quarterly magazine ""Intelligence Report""

SPLC nearly always focuses on hate crimes where the victims are blacks, jews, and gays; and the perpetrators are white supremacists, neo-Nazi skinheads, or Ku Klux Klan

But this SPLC article showed that unlike on the mainland, most of the hate crimes in Hawaii are directed against Caucasians.  And then, feeling a need to cater to its overwhelmingly leftwing readership, a separate SPLC article ""blamed the victim"" by providing a justification for anti-white hate crimes, citing historical grievances for the overthrow of the monarchy.

In answer to your question, military casualties would far outnumber civilian casualties if the USA and China got together and blasted their way in through the south and west, in a cooperative attack.

It would be an attack with an end result of total surrender and total obliteration of the current government structure.

My layperson prediction would be between 50,000 and 250,000 dead North Korean military members and between 10,000 and 30,000 dead civilians. That sort of range. Could be double that, could be half that, but that sort of order of magnitude.

"This is a ridiculous debate to even have.  The single largest hurdle wind/solar cannot pass over is ""energy density;"" ie, it simply requires too much 'space' to produce; on millions of acres of a limited resource: Land.  

Wind/solar would have to expand 10 times its current land use to come close to replacing carbon-based generation.  That doesn't account for future capacity needs beyond 2040.  Even the sea-based projects have significant return problems for the money spent.  Polis and Johnston are typical opportunists, preying on an engineering-deficient and largely uninformed electorate.  

If we stay on the 'renewables' path, the economics kill solar/wind long before we hit 2030.  2040 is a 'pipedream.'",0

"South of River St., the Bayview extension and the LRT could be stacked on top of GO, with GO in a flood-proof tunnel, like the RER along the Seine, with a walking/bike path along the river.
.
The Bayview extension could be elevated to run flush with Gerrard, Dundas, and Queen, like the boulevard in Sarajevo beside the River - with a long LRT/GO/TTC station between Dundas & Queen. 
.
Since the DRL is going to go under Eastern Avenue, the LRT could branch west at Dundas, Queen (or to enter a portal and merge with the DRL) and King, while GO continues to Union.
.
Surface running on Dundas, Queen and King takes pressure off Union.  That means nested gauges.  Easier to get rid of TTC gauge.
.
It could move 40,000 riders/hour.
It would take so much pressure off the Yonge line.
It could run all the way to Richmond Hill.
It would cost nothing compared to the DRL.
It could be in service at least a decade before the DRL.

You're talking about essentials and I couldn't agree more. I prefer that approach because I've found that people who are led to fall in love with Jesus and have a dynamic relationship with Him are eager to learn more. In contrast with that are the people who are taught a certain set of specifically-detailed doctrines as if knowing them was essential for salvation. So I like the idea of having a short set of baptisimal vows followed by a discipleship process where new believers are nurtured in their continued study. A good comparison might be a person earning a degree, then getting a job and discovering there is a whole lot more to learn and that the learning will continue through their entire career.",0

As for taking all the guns. Sorry if you actually believe that is my position. It's not, quite the opposite. I hold that is the position of most liberals and that any gun law passed will only be a stepping stone to their ultimate goal.

For that reason, if you want to get a law passed you will need to show that it will be effective at reducing gun violence (not stopping one shooter) and at the same time have the minimal damage to A2.

Obviously there would still  be some  abortions performed illegally, but the abortion rate would drop to very low levels compared to what we are seeing today. I also disagree that the majority of abortions are performed due to financial reasons.  I think most are a matter of convenience, plain and simple.  If abortion was illegal do you actually think abortions would be performed in a hospital? I  would tend to believe most miscarriages that would require an expulsion  are handled in a hospital setting.

The Court emphasized that care must be taken not to evolve an Aboriginal right into a modern right that is different than the Aboriginal right.  

 The court was clear that a ""gathering right"" to berries based on pre-contact times would not, for example, ""evolve"" into a right to ""gather"" natural gas within the traditional territory.

We are not even close to seeing the bottom of the economy. The housing market has been artificially subsidized by the nearly 0% interest from the fed since 2008 that supports high housing prices at low monthly payments. Many houses were sold by real-estate agents convincing people to buy because they could live in a nicer house with a lower payment than the cost of rent. There has been a very tight rental market during the boom of high oil prices. We will begin to see many places for rent. Rents will become lower in price. Land lords will lower prices and offer incentives and many will loose over priced rental properties to foreclosure. Noticing for rent signs around town will be the first indication of a faltering housing economy. Next will be more and more for sale signs. Selling a house will require loss of equity,0

People can have legitimate issues with Obama and Clinton and refuse to vote for them while not being racist or sexist.

"Monetization of Sports.  As we become more sophisticated in our knowledge base, it's hard not to see that virtually every aspect of a football game is designed to get money from you, and get money for the player, coach and owner.   The college player is playing for a shot at the pros (and the kala that comes with it).  The Pro player is playing for his next contract.  The coaches are all working to keep their jobs.  And the owners? of the pro or college programs?  They want your money.  Clearly.  They're even infiltrating your heart and emotions to try to squeeze coin out of it.  

 Since I come from a time when the ideals of sports were still the priority (as opposed to the money available at some point), I think I can say with authority that the monetization issue has sullied sports, and football in particular.

The Castro legacy becomes clearer when one realizes that 20 % of the population fled his tyrany and horrid living conditions; often risking life are and limb crossing to the U.S. in flimsy rafts. 

To say that Castros' legacy is anything but a betrayal of the Cuban peoples is an insult to basic human rights and freedoms expected by Canadians and of their representatives abroad. 

By not condemming (in the most vigorous way) 50 years of mass political imprisonment, torture, political executions; the crushing of free speech, free assembly, free press, and by not condemming the ensuing impoverishment, food and housing shortages; one can only conclude that the distinguished Entwistle is a fool, a closet Marxist, or has ulterior motives.

Of course, as a signals intelligence aircraft, it was nevertheless forcibly boarded for intelligence exploitation. 
The determination to get it back would have been political as well as a desire to limit Chinese intelligence collection efforts. Followed by a technical analysis of how much of the destruction bill got implemented before the boarding and an assessment of how thorough and competent the Chinese effort was.

This is a very obvious factor in this case: If the price of oil is low no one wants to invest in the expensive oil production we have in the Canadian oil sands, therefore it doesn't make much sense to expand pipelines to carry oil out of the oil sands, there just won't be the oil to transport!

On the flip side some pipelines will benefit from LOWER prices as that raises demand and therefore they'll be transporting more.",0

I am a lifelong democrat and hate that nationally we have reduced taxes on high earners through reducing high earner marginal tax rates and caps on capital gains and estate taxes. And from that standpoint the PFD reduction is regressive and bad for low earners.

Also, our state is spending more for essential services than it is producing in revenue. Doesn't it make more sense to limit PFD distributions than to implement and administratively burdensome income tax?

Secondly, Congress lobbed Walker a softball when they chose to appropriate PFD earnings rather than relying on law to do the same thing. The reason Walker has this power to veto half of it is because the legislature gave it to him.",0

Canada and Canadians would actually save money (or at least break even) if political parties were funded for elections and all donations banned.   The savings from the tax credits alone might pay for it, since donations up to $400 are credited 75%.    Yes, that's right - when somebody donates $400 (or less) the taxpayer ends up paying 75% of that (eg:  $300 of the $400 is subsidized by the taxpayer).

There are reduced fees if you have a large holding and if you stay with the company for years.  He notes that the fee of the Founders Fund is 1.34%.  That is in the first $100K.  Amounts from $100K to $250K get a 20% reduction or a fee of 1.07%.  Amounts from $250K to $500K get 30% off (.94%) and over $500K get 40% off (.80%).

Furthermore, all accounts held by family members living at the same address are totaled for these calculations.  e.g. if you and your spouse each have $100 K, you get 20% off on $100K.

"actually, you're wrong. companies do not go about their business trying to pay women less. It's all BS.  Businesses will pay a woman more, if she works harder and is more valuable to the business. If she isn't, they won't. Same goes for a man. My company employs 25 people.  over half of the senior people are women, and get paid more than some men, in similar positions. Why?  Because they are better at their jobs, and worth more to the company than the others.  Merit, that's it.  Problem is actually that most people, assume that if they have the same job, and same tenure, they automatically assume they should be paid the same.  That only works for people who don't want to work harder or more efficiently than others.  If that's not fair, you probably don't own a business, and are getting paid by some branch of government",0

Perhaps all teachers should have to go to the principal's office twice a day and blow into a breathalyzer for you too, Richard.

But studded tires are MUCH more effective at slowing rapidly on glaze ice, and for many other conditions with ice as a factor.

I would suggest that roughly half the population will be upset in any election cycle, by the nature of elections, as there will be a winner and a loser. What bothers me, is the vitriol that I'm seeing this time around (from both sides).  

So I wish you all well, especially in your spiritual journeys.  I hope folks here can find ways to honestly reconcile the kinds of attacks I've seen and continue to see here, with those spiritual journeys.

In a time of climate change and in a country with where the average meal has 1500 food miles, more aquaponics is badly needed.  Aquaponics can more easily be done in a controlled environment and uses only about 5% of the water that soil agriculture does.

There is an argument that some hydroponic growers are growing in GMO sludge.  Yes that needs to change.  And so do the organic soil farms that use conventional chicken manure from birds that are fed GMOs.

Of course a 50 percent reduction would slow warming a bit but not stop it.  Unfortunately, massive elimination of fossil fuel use would radically change our society and the costs we the people would have to bear would be dreary.  I suspect that most warmers are not really educated about how massive the problem of stopping CO2 build-up is.

Utter and total rubbish.

Go to *anywhere* in Asia, or the Middle East and ask what they think of 'Black people'. They will tell you calmly, openly that Blacks are a 'lower form' of existence in one way or another.

Most places are extremely ethnocentric.

An African cannot get a remotely normal job in most Asian or Middle Eastern countries.

Most nations outside the Anglosphere have pretty strict form of social hierarchy - at least in UK, Canada, US, Australia - we recognize it and have policy, action, we make amends.

What is chilling here, is that there is clearly the appearance of pressure and/or censorship in representing science to the public. Anyone, ""left"" or ""right"" (or ambidextrous) should find that unacceptable.",0

And yes, for almost all it is the shortage of priests, but why not use the deacons to staff the parishes, and let them keep their day jobs, etc.  it all could work, but for some reason those in charge, the bishops who have the last word it seems, they just are inflexible to this idea.

Often it is stated that there are 44 million American without health care insurance. That is tremendous. It means that 15% of Americans do not have insurance. 85% do. Thus if Canada went for private health care, the taxpayer would not have to carry 85% of Canadians. What a reduction in health care budget!

US health care could be best in the world by a Guaranteed Annual Income FOR THE POOR. Only 15% of Americans.

"Always good to learn and/or remember that both of the Genesis Creation stories are myth literary forms.

And that myth stories are based on and incorporate lived human experience. However or whenever the custom and 'law' of 'Sabbath Rest' developed – whether from Moses, or a custom pre-dating that – the first creation story is attributed to Priestly origin and , as usual, makes a god into the 'image and likeness of man' so as to make man into a likeness of that God-image.

The myth describes even God 'resting' – and having to do all his 'labor' of creating everything in 6 days so that even God has to observe the 7th day Sabbath and take a break. Though just saying 'Let it be"" does not seem so strenuous!

But first came the human experience of Sabbath' observance -- and THEN the Biblical authors develop the myth story that explains the practice as being based on God and Six Days of creation work so that on 'the seventh day God rested' as giving a 'why' for the law about the 'Sabbath'.",0

It's what we did federally in the 1980's when Mulroney was adding various high income surtaxes, the GST etc. The more he taxed, the less economic activity there was and the higher the deficit went. You have to decide whether you want to stimulate the economy, or if you're a deficit slayer, because trying to do both at the same time is a fools errand. If you want to juice the economy, you ramp up government spending over a 2 or 3 year period and cut taxes, with the idea you get back to a balanced budget over the medium term once the economy has rebounded. The Conservatives did that federally and it worked very well. Taxes are regressive. The NDP are just taking a lot more of some people's money and running up the credit card at the same time.",0

In Canada very few people living in poverty are the ""working poor"".  As per the following article, of the 3,040,000 Canadians living in poverty, only 746,000 (24.5%) lived in a household where someone was working at least 910 hours/year (roughly full time for 6-months of the year):

https://www.canada.ca/en/employment-social-development/programs/poverty-reduction/backgrounder.html?=undefined&wbdisable=true#h2.5

Further, about 40% of those ""working poor"" are self employed and therefore minimum wage rules don't apply.

In order to have the costs paid directly by the Last Post Fund, you have to contact them before you make the funeral arrangements. If you don't, you have to pay the costs yourself and then apply retroactively to have the costs reimbursed - you have a year to do that.

"""In his first days in office, President Donald Trump has launched a major effort to hurt job growth, stifle innovation, and make Americans sicker and less productive. How? By waging war on regulations, particularly those designed to protect the environment.
Trump ran on a pledge to kill regulations, and focused much of his wrath on EPA climate rules such as the Clean Power Plan. Upon assuming office, he put in place a “freeze” on all federal regulations; told business leaders “we’re going to be cutting regulation massively” by 75 percent or “maybe more”; and told car company executives that environmental regulations are “out of control.”
Yet, contrary to popular myth, regulations such as clean air and water standards do not have a net negative impact on job growth. Indeed, studies have found that the exact type of regulations Trump is targeting actually spur innovation and competitiveness.""

I like this. But education can only ENCOURAGE entrepreneur-like behaviour, not create it. Only a small percentage of the population has what it takes. But the mindset should be nurtured. Often isn't. Worse, it's sometimes maligned. 

One of the sad realities of existing next to the USA: it's easier to leech off our neighbour in so many ways; culturally, economically. Even Canadians who APPEAR entrepreneurial (as business owners/managers) are really more conservative than American counterparts.

"When you read articles like this it makes it that much more clear that Trump and his administration do not understand much about anything. Take this for example, they clearly have little comprehension of business and market forces. Their goal is to keep investment from the Auto sector in the US and thus, apparently, create jobs for Americans. Here's the thing, if 85% of vehicle content must be from NA, and 50% from US, the cost of American made cars will skyrocket. The US cannot manufacture as cheap as Canada and Mexico (lower wages and currency), and North America cannot manufacture at the cost of China, India, Malayasia, etc.

 American auto manufacturers' COGS will increase and competitiveness with Japanese and European will decrease. The already struggling North American automaker (GM, Ford, Chrysler) will have to  have have to accept reduced margins (at same price point), or increase prices and have less price competitive products. Either way, they'll have less to invest.",0

"""Contact between a private citizen with a foreign government is different than contact between a government official and a foreign government.""

Oh really?

Cite the legal basis for that brain fart.

As for proof, we have Donald Jr. admitting that he met with  Russians who explicitly promised information that “would incriminate Hillary and her dealings with Russia and would be very useful to your father.”

Trump Jr.’s response? “If it’s what you say I love it especially later in the summer.”

And to corroborate all this Jr. released the string of emails that took place prior to the meeting.

In May we heard Trump admit he fired Comey because of the Russia thing, and them told his Russian handlers in the Oval Office that firing Comey relieved a great deal of pressure.

All we have to do is patiently wait for these nincompoops to further incriminate themselves. It's obvious to everyone except Trump sycophants like you.",1

"Its an interesting article Louie, thanks for sharing! I used the Google Scholar search engine to try to find abstracts of peer reviewed research. Unfortunately, after an hour of tweaking my search parameters, all I could find is the 2015 report in Science. I'm surprised I couldn't find evidence of peer review. I am not a Geophysicist( or anything close to it) so I don't subscribe to the American Geophysical Review or some other such journal I would find dense and unfathomable( there are many reasons I'm a botanist!).

The conservative SC justice, TPP, NAFTA, Paris climate accord, rescinding Obama's executive orders and Keystone were all key promises.

If by the 2018 midterms, if Trump has still not gotten major legislation passed on healthcare overhaul, tax reform or the border wall, you would have a somewhat of a point.

That training has been targeted on lay people who work there and not on clergy and especially not on Bishops. Their financial problems are self made.

"I urge readers to take a close look at charter amendment question #4.  In addition to putting rail O&M under one agency (which needs to be done), it also gives HART the authority to issue revenue bonds.  Revenue bonds for transit agencies are typically backed by fares.  If this amendment passes, however, fares would be under DTS.

That leaves us to wonder what type of revenue would back these bonds.  We know that Caldwell and Djou oppose using RPT to fund rail construction, and we know some in the legislature do not support a surcharge extension.  

How about a new tax?  A $70 per vehicle rail tax could bring in $2.1 billion over 30 years, based on about 1 million vehicles on Oahu.  Yes, this would have to be approved by the legislature, and yes, the current surcharge law would need to be changed, but it sure looks like we're being set up for something here.

Yes, Qatargas has multiple LNG 'trains' and has been operating for decades. It is the world's largest provider of LNG (Australia is #2).

Why is Syria necessary for LNG?
It's not. But global demand for nat-gas continues to increase and Qatar will clearly benefit from supplying that demand. A pipeline between Qatar and Turkey would allow Qatari gas to flow to Europe via the Nabucco pipeline and/or LNG export terminals.
This would compete directly with Russian gas and surely explains why Syria has no interest in facilitating any such pipeline. 
Meanwhile, options for a pipeline to the Mediterranean are extremely limited because it must cross Saudi Arabia and then Iraq or Syria, etc.

Furthermore, USA fancies itself as an exporter of LNG and stands to benefit from a squeeze on Qatari gas. So the web is indeed a tangled one.",0

-If we ban all Muslims, can we ban Catholics from entering the US as well?

-What if someone was born a Muslim and deconverts or switches to another religion?  Will they be considered ""approved"" or be banned for life if their name is Mohammed or Aisha?   

-Would we have to put all Americans who convert to Islam in jail preemptively?  How about Americans who convert to Catholicism?

The BC Liberals only have a handful that served more 16 years in government. Clark did a lot more in six and half years than all the BC NDP did in a decade of governance.  Moreover, unlike the BC NDP, Clark actually knows that a party can only truly move on when the old leader is no longer hanging around - you can say she was push or whatever, but have a look at all the old leaders that BC NDP have kicking around - Carole James and Adrian Dix - you can't even get rid of them and they want folks to believe that they are somehow different.

The people appointed by the 12 Apostles and Paul to lead the early Church communities were all 'laity'. 'Clerics' had not been invented as yet.

According to Vatican 2 the Bishop is the 'THE Priest' of the Diocese.
 
The Bishop then delegates his powers of teaching and administration and administering sacraments to others - as determined by the customs developed over centuries and encoded in 'Canon Law'.

Custom, as enshrined in Canon Law, has set up a 'clerical' system for those parts of his powers that a Bishop delegates to a 'priest' or 'deacon'. 

But customs can and have changed. Many of a Bishop's Administrative functions are now  delegated to non-cleric 'laity'. Qualified Laity 'teach',  in Schools and Universities, and in the parish. Laity give marriage prep. They lead RCIA classes They are Communion Ministers.

In short, 'laity' do whatever a Bishop delegates them to do. He CAN choose to 'ordain' non-cleric laity.",0

If on the other hand as some bishops have declared, such couples can continue in their adulterous relationship and at the same time receive the Sacraments of Penance and the Eucharist then the doctrine has definitely changed. So which is it?
Two directly opposed interpretations of AL are doing the rounds and the Pope stubbornly refuses to clarify which is the correct one.

"The KEY to real estate is that when interest rates tank, the PRICES of homes go up.  Why?  Because people buy on monthly payments.  If the payments are cut in half as they were (from 8%+ to 4% or lower, you can afford more house.)  So the prices increase naturally.  If the sale is on in the store for an item and it is now 2 for the price of 1, people will buy two of them.  Same thing for homes.  People refi the loan, and cut their monthly nut in half.  Or, they refi out and take some money and invest it.  When rates go up, prices go down.  If the rates went to 10% like in the 90's, the price of housing would go down dramatically because people could not afford the monthly payments.  It is simple math.  People buy on monthly payments.  They buy what they can afford. The rates are rising now, so the price of housing will go flat or decline in the next year.  The key is to buy when rates are high, then refi when they drop. That way you buy low and your payments are low.  Simple logic.",0

Do we get someone elected who will vote for conservative principles, in the face of strong controversial press coverage, or, do we get someone elected who is decidedly un-controversial, and may not support a good portion of what is conservative in nature?

Do we get a sure majority that ensures the prevention of wild eyed Democrat, far left policy, but allows for a great deal of improper policy, that looks decidedly Democrat-lite?

Or, do we go for the brass ring, running real conservatives that, should they win, ensure solid conservative voting?

Clearly, the former is a delaying strategy, unlikely to EVER yield positive results, rather, aimed at mitigating negative results. The latter is the goal, though it brings some risk.

I don't want to close the income gap, men to women - the gap will exist because most women and men work at different jobs, and if they are doing the same jobs, they often will work different hours/year. In any event that is up to the couple to work out.

Houses are primarily for living in, not a speculative investment.  You can choose to speculate, but when that drives prices so high that the primary purpose is threatened, then some regulation of the market is needed to preserve that purpose.

You are suggesting ugly things about Islam despite the fact that I can point equally ugly things in the Bible.  Real people are getting hurt by Trump and his policies and his racist supporters.

"The excellent data gathering and analysis in The Spirit Level (Google it) shows that living conditions in developed countries are not affected by GNP per person. For example the US is the richest developed country and the poorest developed country to live in. Conversely, Japan is an economic basket case and best developed country to live in.

Living conditions in 23  developed countries correlate beautifully with income inequality (top 20% of income earners divided by bottom 20% ). The lower the inequality, the better the living conditions.

It would be quite a shift for the Globe and Mail to have a Report on Living Conditions since Report on Business has been such an integral part of the Globe. The Report on Business is appropriate for developing countries since their living conditions do depend on wealth. It is no longer appropriate for Canada, except of course for the business people. They grow wealthier with a bigger GDP/person.

Now, how to decrease income inequality. A challenge.",0

In 2012, Trump railed against Obama for not negotiating a good deal for the bailout. As usual, he made false claims, this time about Chrysler moving its Jeep production to China. Point of fact, they were opening a plant in China to serve the Asian market and avoid tariffs. Now, Trump pretends the bailout never happened and that his election is rebuilding the auto industry. Two key traits of an autocrat are detachment from reality and craving mass adulation at any cost. Trump suffers from both. Obama received adulation, he did not seek to create it but his loyalists were blinded by the light and he turned out to be a Jimmy Carter intellectual with little concern or patience for good advice.",0

Have abandoned us or we abandoned them
And you cast about and try to find new meaning

For everything that matters carry on.

When we all had to care or all was lost

And a veil of isolation in their eyes
And inside you know you've got to leave them something
Or the hope for something better slowly dies.

"Real life example of how a tax influences business.
I know of a business  in Washington County, that grosses 2.3 million. Most of the work is performed in WashCo. But a small part - about $33,000- is done in Multnomah County/ Portland.
The average profit margin of this business is about 7%.
The profit on the Multnomah County/Portland sales is therefore $2,310, and the tax on the MultCo/PDX sales is $1,200. That's an effective tax rate on profit of  about 52%. And, that's not all, it's an S. Corp. so the remaining $1,110 of profit is taxed to the owner as personal income at the combined federal/State rate of 34%. Leaving the owner with a net after tax profit of $704.
Here are the owners options.
Raise prices on consumers
Continue with MultCo/PDX business for a 2% return on investment

My son is Army counterintelligence and just returned from his 7th deployment, but his second to Korea. He isn't worried, so I'm not either.

"Francios Francis - Did you read the actual paper or the abstract?

According the authors, “In the present study, we demonstrated that protective efficacy of EGCG against fluoride (Fl) induced oxidative stress mediated lung injury in rats.”  And “Oral administration of Fl (25mg/kg/bw) significantly increased [various problems] in rats.”

Group 1: Control

Group 2: EGCG (40mg/kg/bw)

*** Group 3: Fl (25mg/kg/bw) ***

Group 4: EGCG & Fl

Unless I am missing something not included in the abstract, the 25mg/kg/bw doses administered to the rats would translate to:

Feeding a 10 pound baby (4.5 Kg), 25mg x 4.5Kg=112.5 mg of fluoride – the equivalent of drinking 42 gallons of optimally fluoridated water a day.

Feeding a 200 pound adult (90.7 Kg), 25 x 90.7=2,267 mg of fluoride – or the amount in 855 gallons of fluoridated water.

It's a pure guess, but I think very few women ask for money to get an abortion.

If the male wants some say in the decision to continue a pregnancy, than he should accept that he has to sustain that child, physically, emotionally, and in his own PERSONAL care for at least half of the child's life.     How may unmarried men would be OK with that? I would guess less than 5%, (it will Never pass as law in a male dominated legal profession).

Furthermore, a large amount of natural gas is ""flared"" off at the well if it is not captured and sent elsewhere.  It is burned whether it is used to generate power or simply wasted at the site it is produced.  Using the power instead of wasting it further reduces emissions.

There are thousands of miles of pipelines in the US.  While leaks are an understandable concern, they are infrequent.   In a state with incredible poverty, here is a 7.5 billion dollar investment that will generate enormous tax revenue.

"Monte,

Assuming that anything in the Levitical laws was equivalent to a modern redistribution of wealth shows how willing Liberals in Christianity are to twist scripture in their search to justify modern Socialist/Communist concepts. Nothing in scripture remotely resembles how Liberalism claims to be helping the poor. For example, farmers were supposed to not harvest the edges of their fields so travelers and the poor could find food. Ruth and her family gleaned fields to find food because only a single harvest was allowed so the poor could eat. That wasn't a tax, it was how as a society they lived God's love.

The God used five dinner rolls and two fish to feed 5,000 is offering us His power to do mighty and marvelous things that demonstrate His love and power. So, why would we imagine seeking to use corrupt human power that is dedicated to the destruction of faith to do the works He wants us doing?",0

Looking to the most expensive and inefficient model (the American one) doesn't seem a good solution to the problems facing Canadian health care.",0

That ""century"" ended long AGO when the USA repeatedly undermined the institutions it helped create after WWII - Iraq was the most egregious but many others equally important have played out since Obama came to power -

their refusal to sign the ICC, 

using NATO for out of area ops to impose regime change in Libya -

 undermining governments in the middle east, 

turning a blind eye to genocide in Rwanda and South Sudan while instigating civil war in Iraq and Syria

being the lone hold out in condemning Israel's illegal occupation  (and nuclear inspections)

I guess  this is the new normal. 

Here in Richmond, surplus school land was converted to a townhouse community (with prices over a million).  Lineups for pre-sales. Speculation had a hand in it too, as  some buyers bought multiples.

If there ever is an armed rebellion in America, it won't be against the people, it will be against ""Citizens United"", and those who foisted it on us.
Also, the militia is not ""heavily armed"".  They have no anti-tank or anti-aircraft weapons.  They cannot win any rebellion without the aid of our military.  Sentiment is hardening within the ranks, and in the event of any American rebellion, odds are in favor of the military joining with them.

"Another frequent problem that the doctors were running into with the ACA is that the doctor's office would call for confirmation of coverage, and if the patient had applied for a policy, the coverage was confirmed, so the doctor accepted the coverage and performed the services.  But the ACA was allowing a 90-day grace period to pay the initial premium, and if it wasn't paid ... as it often wasn't ... the claim from the doctor was denied, stiffing him/her for the entire bill.

The ACA has had an adversarial relationship with the health care providers, who are, after all, people exchanging their labor and property for money.  If you think you have a ""right"" to their services and property without their agreement on compensation, you believe in a return to slavery.",0

Maybe that would be a problem if this was just a Toronto newspaper but it defiantly claims to be national in scope.  Sure this was business decision but it wasn't based on there not being enough oil (Alberta has enough for centuries) or there not being enough investment  in expansion (if they build it they will come) it was solely the predicted result of the LIberal  mid stream changing the ground rules so sharply that no responsible company like TC could risk further billions on this project. It was utterly the result of the Trudeau LIberals forcing the NEB to calculate the down-stream contribution of CO2 to the environment and it's impact on climate change.

A John Horgan NDP government will not necessarily be similar to Glen Clark's.  And I think 4 more years of a Christy Clark would be worse.

Members of the Commercial Association of Realtors are, to my knowledge, not ipso facto, members of the ""National Association of Realtors"" and, therefore, ""Realtors"" with a capital R.  Again, may I repeat.  A Realtor (capital R) is also a realtor, but a realtor (lower case R) is not necessarily a Realtor (a member of the National Association of Realtors.

Let me use an example.  All squares are also rectangles.  But rectangles are NOT necessarily squares.  Does that help?

It is not condoning or condemning IV use, but remaining neutral and viewing the issue as being medical rather than criminal. It allows the problem to remain above ground so it can be dealt with in a humane manner. That is just a rough explanation; there is obviously much more to it.

Harm reduction is a well known and academic study, and can be found in peer review databases.

Then when they lose their health as everyone does sooner or later, they expect others to pay, for their catastrophic care in the ER. Why? because they've lost their health and can't afford the high premiums resulting from many others refusing to enroll. Please tell me you understand this truly simple, factual, real-world situation.

In addition, most of our health care industry isn't socialized. The insurance bought on the ACA is private. The medical treatment is nearly 100% private. Our Medicare and Medicaid are ""socialized"" but we, the people, still pay for it.

NAFTA in its current form would remain in force but politics, markets & forward planning by Governments, industries, corporations, etc. would be impeded for a protracted period.

After Iraq, it could have--should have--done the same.

It even forgot it HAD one. It was a proven success. All the US had to do was follow it.  The plan's authors were General Douglas MacArthur and his advisors, who took war-ravaged Japan into the post-war era--peacefully.  But the USA somehow forget it had a plan.  It forgot why it worked so well. (For more, read the books of  retired Army lieutenant colonel Ralph Peters--damning and fascinating.)

The Tax Code is nearly 76,000 pages. There is a plethora of carve outs, favors, kickbacks, whatever you wish to refer to them as, that go to the well connected. By simplifying everything at the individual level and removing the carve outs, the money is more easily identified (and taxed). 

Companies will still have to file their 10 Ks, will still have to be audited for shareholder purposes and companies, by law, will have to pay dividends to keep retained earnings from becoming a tax shelter.

"According to the National Academy of Science, here's what the evidence shows about CANNABIS EDIBLES:
Edibles make it harder to titrate the intoxicating effects due to the delayed and variable onset. Consequently, edibles have been tied to the ingestion of excessive amounts of cannabis under the misperception that the initial dose had not produced the desired effect. The availability of edibles has also been associated with increased rates of accidental pediatric ingestion of cannabis.
Meanwhile, the increasing availability, diversity, and potency of cannabis products create the potential for an increased risk of adverse health effects related to cannabis use, including overdose injury and death. Accidental ingestion of high-potency cannabis products by young children can result in respiratory failure and coma, as noted by several case reports. Cannabis edibles were identified as a contributing factor in the acute psychosis and death of at least one adolescent who jumped off a building.",0

We adopted a wild mustang 4 years ago and have enjoyed raising him while in captivity.  He is a very intelligent creature compared to his domestic counterpart.  Over the time we have had our horse we have been able to bond with him more than we would were he a domestic horse.  I would encourage anyone looking to buy a horse to consider adopting one from the BLM auction held yearly where buyers come together to bid on the wild horses that have been captured.  Horses in the wild do not overgraze as many think they would but travel distances of about 20 miles per day in grazing an area.  I have rarely found herds or bands of horses that stay in the same grazing area for any length of time.,0

Yet they do not usually appeal. Because their approach is to evict unconstitutionally and challenge it in court using a trial to buy time. Once they lose they do what they should have done in the first place. But only for those who can afford a court challenge and 6 months to a year later.

If the issue is mental health than why would you eliminate minimum essential health benefits that treat mental health as any other health problem.

My own take on colonization is that it is an inevitability, talking into account our nature. Few nations have not been colonized. Stands to reason that if Africa wasn't colonized it would colonized others itself (generally speaking instead of calling out specific ethnic groupings like the Zulus or the Ashanti)  and did to some extent. So it's not so much the colonization itself that is problematic, but how the colonisers behaved towards the colonized.

""Opponents of the project have raised concerns about increased traffic, noise and parking problems. They fear a second synagogue next door would lower their property values and mean higher taxes, because religious institutions are exempt from taxation.""

"Von Papen, an authoritarian, conservative Catholic, more than any other individual was responsible for Hitler's appointment as chancellor. To be fair, the German Catholic parties disliked Hitler but grossly miscalculated him and the conspiracy against Chancellor Kurt von Schelicher. Anxious at the possibility that Papen, from whom they were estranged, might be reinstated as chancellor and resort to extra-constitutional rule, the Catholic parties agreed to support Hitler and what they believed would be a parliamentary cabinet that would afford them a check on his power. But they got played.

Every single one in the tiny group of men who determined the fate of Germany and the world believed they could control Hitler in his role as chancellor. It's chilling to contemplate.

That's practical politics rather than intellectual pandering to the intelligentsia in this country by refusing to acknowledge that terrorists are terrorists.

Finding qualified people who advocate for the city's greater good seems more important than a representative from a neighborhood who advocates for the neighborhood first and then secondarily for the city as a whole. The article suggests that the CC should have paid the money and put it on the ballot but isn't it more fair for those who feel strongly about it to pony up rather than the public?

Comey testified that neither the FBI nor the Department of Justice found any evidence to support Trump’s claim.  Exactly what did Comey debunk?  Was it that there was no wiretapping, that Obama did not order it or both?  I contend he was saying Obama did not order it and not that there was no wiretapping.  Comey also testified about two ongoing investigations, one being counter intelligence, which undoubtedly involved wiretapping and other surveillance techniques that would have required warrants.

This isn't a freedom of speech issue.  People are free to express pro-confederate views if they wish.  The question is whether or not certain monuments, which can be seen by some as glorifying traitors and slavery, should be displayed in public areas (or on government grounds).

Many people are ignorant of the law in general. If a US citizen steals another person's identity they can go to prison.  If they have no citizenship but are permanent residents (have a green card), their green card will be canceled and they will have to go back to their native country.

I fully realize that change takes a long time, but there will no one around to be responsible for what we are doing if it doesn't work. Saying we have to do something, is not the same as saying what we are doing is working. Putting  a tax on carbon doesn't mean people will stop what they are doing, it just means they will pay more. Solar and wind power are still minuscule in terms of the world power, and the electric car market is still in its infancy, regardless of the hype.

Of course, the other possibility is the GOP rejecting someone who does not seem pro-life enough, like they did with Harriet Miers, but that is not likely either.

"""China should not expect rapid progress on a comprehensive extradition treaty with Canada, or on a free-trade agreement, the Liberal government indicated Sunday.

“Promoting and protecting human rights is an integral part of Canada’s foreign policy and remains an unwavering priority for the government,” Alex Lawrence, a spokesperson for Foreign Affairs Minister Chrystia Freeland said Sunday by e-mail. “Canada engages regularly with its Chinese counterparts on a number of issues, including those related to human rights.”

--

The right approach.

China's economy is such that any nation engaging in international trade as a significant part of their economic structure must deal with China.

However, any nation that values human rights must, ethically, strive to factor China's appalling record into its relations with China and attempt to influence China to improve how it treats is own citizens.

Human Rights are universal rights and  Human Rights don't recognize borders.

"You understand that not all 10 carriers are currently at sea, right?

Just because there are 10 carriers we normally only have 2 or 3 actually forward deployed a time. The other carriers are in shipyards doing maintenance that allows them to be forward deployed. These periods are typically 9 months to a year unless they are being refueled. That takes three years. After coming out of the shipyard the ship starts to train to be deployed again. That takes a year. And tragically we just recently saw what happens when a ship fails at it's training with the U.S.S. Fitzgerald.

I understand that some believe that this is money just being thrown away but at the rate our carriers are deployed we really are at the minimum of carriers we need.

My first ship was the U.S.S. Eisenhower CVN 69, the newest Nimitz class at the time. It is 40 years old this year and is slated to retire in 2027. To be replaced by the U.S.S. Enterprise CVN 80.

"That, of course, is not true of all ordained ministers.  Deacons are volunteers, are not paid for ministry nor do they acquire health insurance or a place to live.  It also is true that many priests and some bishops have no idea what to do with a deacon, much as they have no idea what do to with a lay minister.  Priests are not taught in the seminary to be pastors, administrators of a parish, they are taught to be priests.  Seminary training still pretends that every rectory has a handful of priests who are preparing for service as a pastor.  In many dioceses, that preparation is disjointed, highly variable in quality and frequently lasts less than two years.  That's barely time to learn how to be a priest, much less a pastor.  Seminaries are way behind the reality of Church life, time for them to spend some time forming seminarians to be pastors as well as priests.  Almost all of them will be pastors, usually within a couple of years of ordination.",0
"Keolu doesn't know what a control group is from a hole in the wall. He cites discredited review papers of the groundbreaking study. Here is a quote of a rebuttal that was appended to the review paper probably because the publisher of a professional Journal wanted to document all of Keolus unfounded arguments against the original study.

""While fair criticism is essential to the scientific method and the advancement of knowledge, unfair criticism undermines the scientific method and presents unhelpful information masquerading as knowledge....  We do appreciate the opportunity to respond to these criticisms, however, particularly those that Besharov and his colleagues repeat from other sources to which we have never directly replied.

In typically American fashion, I care less about population-level outcomes than I do about individual access, cost, and incentives for responsible behavior.

Relatively speaking, the Japanese-American Internment was a walk in the park compared to how American POW's were treated by Japan in the Phillipines during The Bataan Death March.

Beg to differ:
- unlike JPII or even Benedict, note that Francis has been transparent and provided the history of his curial decisions; explanations why; and expectations going forward.  He has used this process as a template for all of the curia - offers a model of adult decision making; he becomes a mentor - not a father figure with all of its psychological baggage.
- i.e. he expects other leaders to deal with *problems* - not top down only

There's also an independent filmmakers' movement, which is still laying a foundation for its efforts.

He graduated from Yale law school, clerked for Supreme Court Justice Breyer, was Solicitor General under Obama for a while, and took over Chief Justice Roberts' practice when Roberts went to the Supreme Court.

@John Kawamoto has some good company here.  

I didn't hear it myself, but I'm confident Trump really blustered about a ""complete and total shutdown"" of Muslim immigration.  That's a campaign promise the Constitution probably won't let him keep.

In their place, the right has created its own parallel set of institutions, most notably its own media ecosystem.

1) Would you consider using your real name?  Why hide your identity in a civil debate?

.

3)  If your assumption on the overall impact of the GET is correct, that it’s equivalent to a 12% to 16% sales tax (which I’m prepared to accept only for argument’s sake) then the impact of the 0.5% rail surcharge is 1.2% to 1.6%.  For a family of 5, spending $40,000 per year, that’s equivalent to $480 to $640.  Taking the higher number, the state skim of $30 million per year is sufficient to entirely reimburse the poorest 46,875 families representing 234,375 people on this island.

"Translation: Amazon is looking for a huge taxpayer handout. 

The facts: Amazon employees about 20,000 people at its existing headquarters. Not 50,000.

Amazon stocks price to earnings (P/E) ratio is an absurd 247.02. 

I suspect this ""second headquarters"" will really be a customer service center - perhaps bringing some of the many jobs Amazon now offshores back to the US. Amazon will most certainly not be duplicating the ranks of well paid executives. 

The other possibility - Amazon is looking to shift their headquarters out of Seattle, but doesn't want to face the backlash that will bring in Seattle until they are ready to move. They probably want to move as many low level jobs as possible to somewhere with lower costs of living - and a huge government subsidy. 

If I represent the typical Amazon customer they are in big trouble. I buy less from them all the time as I can get the same or better price locally these days.

Point being: NOTHING happens, really: a solitary person (yes, inevitably, even in TV script-writing, a solitary individual  has to leave the boardroom and the ""writing committee"" and put stuff on a screen, and, later, paper) typing away or stroking through a printed manuscript with a pencil. That's it.  Nothing more to see.

The first is the fact that these producers now supply over 30% of American demand from mills they have purchased in the US. They will benefit from any increase in price. The second reason is that mortality from the pine beetle infestation in BC and Alberta has reduced and will continue to reduce log supplies. It will be neccessary for producers there to close mills no matter what occurs in the way of tariffs and prices. Most likely, what is produced in those provinces will be used to supply growing offshore markets.

The third striking aspect of the decision was that it seemed the Dakotas hadn't done their homework.

Kudos for a logical dissection of the topic. 

I'm curious to know how many Adventists are even familiar with ""Star Trek"" or a ""transporter."" The differences between those who are familiar or not might be an interesting study in spiritual culture change.

It is theological hubris for us to ever think we know all on a topic because God is so much greater than we are and his knowledge and reality so far exceed what He has revealed to us.

""Did you know our ever brilliant legislators changed the way AK is paid oil taxes from GROSS to NET profit?! And worse case scenario was $40/barrel?! 
One economist teaching the class speculated if the oil taxes were still paid on gross, we'd have $4b in oil tax revenue (based on actual barrel market prices) in the bank. 

As Robin Brena has recommended, I say we restructure back to GROSS and have a fair tax structure sans legislator favors!

As the contract was about to expire, PacifiCorp told Reclamation and the federal irrigators that it would not renew it. The irrigators then asked the PUCs to reinstate the low power rate. Water Watch and others did support PacifiCorp's position during those hearings. But that is a far cry from McCarthy's claim that Water Watch and allies were able to ""overturn"" the subsidy. As McCarthy should know, the irrigators attempt to get the PUCs to reinstate the contract was alway a long shot; PUCs rarely if ever fail to support the position of a power generation company. The claim was false and Mr. McCarthy's attempt to justify it highlights the attempted self-promotion and reflects even more unfavorably on Water Watch.",0

"The dysfunctional 2016 renewal of the inflation-control agreement for which Wilkins shares responsibility makes it difficult for her to make a case for raising interest rates. The BoC itself claims that in keeping the target rate at 2% they effectively hiked the true rate of inflation from 1.5% to 1.7%, so 1.8% is really the new 2%. They could have at least made the CPI ex mortgage interest the new target inflation indicator (the BoC is the only G20 central bank that includes mortgage interest cost in its target inflation indicator) but didn’t make even this modest change. The CPI ex mortgage interest rate inflation rate for April 2017 is 1.8%; if the BoC had lowered the target rate of inflation to 1.8% or 1.5% as it should have done, the new target indicator would already be at or above the target rate.

I'm having a hard time explaining this so it makes sense. The press isn't to make a judgment on what happened at an event. Picture it like a secretary recording the minutes of a meeting. All key things are noted, not one single one is left out. They don't decide that one of the board members in a school district has a habit of making false claims that are never backed up, they simply record what occurred. Reporting does all that and then also goes one step further: it reaches out to credible spokespeople on various sides of the issues and elicits their take on the events. This allows us to hear two sides fully so we are fully informed. All that is what I'm after.  Do you agree with that standard?",0

And at least, according to the NFL (2005), only about 46% are college graduates. Perhaps the numbers have dropped or gone up since then and you can provide a current number? but at least that is an official stat to work with rather than a claim without any support.

This is how the courts see, and rightly so, that the diocese needs to financially afford the victim justice. Bishops and their peers and advisors cannot hide from their ineptness in suppressing the Cardinal Virtue of Justice. Because the diocese is a type of corporation, an individual comprised of many individuals, the many parishioners of a diocese are converted into victims. Bankruptcy and reorganization restricts the freedoms of parishioners to worship in the community that they likely helped fund.

In a truly competitive manner our Milk Processors reduced their selling price to compete. They turned to the Canadian  Dairy Producers and said we have to reduce the price we are paying for your milk since we can not get the return we expected. Did the Milk Board or the Canadian Gov't get involved ? NO!
The US Gov't has an archaic  subsidy  system called price supports which forces farmers to over produce in order to get paid. The last figures show the US Federal  Gov't paid out $400 million to dairy farmers for milk excess to market needs. Thus it had to be processed and  dumped on the world market at what ever price it can get.
Canadian milk pricing is based upon the actual cost of production by the average dairy farmer. If you are below average in production efficiency you do not stay in business. Efficiency is a necessity",0

"Income sprinkling and multiple capital gains exemptions are red herrings. The taxation of passive income is the real turkey.  It is devastating to those who hope to retire, look after themselves during a disability or fund maternity leave. 

Keep in mind -- doctors very seldom sell their practices for any significant amount of cash. With too few doctors and too many patients, new doctors are fully booked very soon after opening a new practice. There is seldom a need to buy out a doctor in such circumstances, so buying a practice is very affordable. 

As for dentists, a good dentist might sell his practice for one times gross income, say in the range of $500k or less. There is no multiple capital gains exemption as the capital gain doesn't warrant it.

Exempting the sales of small businesses and farms (as opposed to professional practices) from tax encourages them to be passed down to their children. Otherwise, these companies in times past were often sold to non-residents.",0

""Reaganomics"" aka ""Supply side"" is the idea that we might want to look at the taxation and regulation, the structure, of the supply side of the economy and see if we can make it work a little better. Cuts in the marginal tax rates for corporations is such a very small piece of that its hardly worth mentioning. Thats where I stopped reading 

Just so you know ... Reaganomics didn't presume or assume that all tax cuts increase tax revenues. Even the Laffer Curve--a mathematical certainty when properly stated--only says that sometimes tax rates can be so high that this will be true. We even have real world evidence that certain taxes at certain rates actually lose revenue as those rates are too high.

Secondly, a PF restructure will have to be next, including reduction of the PFD - Alaskans simply won't stand for taxation without this happening first. Third - taxes on motor fuel and vices(Alcohol, tobacco, marijuana) need to be looked at. Fourth on the list is consideration of a sales tax. The last resort should be an income tax. Taxing the productive and working class should not be the first choice. Why would we give a PFD only to tax part of it back. That doesn't make much sense.

"The uniqueness of the Conservative Party, under the leadership of Stephen Harper was that in 2011, he carved out a national majority without having to rely on support from Quebec.  This cut out Quebec from being a player in the Confederation for the first time in Canadian political history.  The CPC only having this capability.

To prevent Quebec from alienation, Harper gave QC carte blanche in most areas of governance.  This was the concept of a nation within a nation.  During this time period, Quebec had separatist governance, stodgy corrupt Liberal governance, and ongoing flirtation with messianic political figures.  The tough economic times, going it on their own, their self exclusion from their significant role in the Confederation, seemingly brought about an epiphany which was that casting itself adrift from Canada was a choice of decline, and that it was better to stay.

Canada matured as a nation and people during this era, all the while balancing the books.  Interesting times.",0

"The American Lung Association endorses ethanol.

Lung-scarring ground-level ozone comes from unburned fuel vapor (either leaked drops or evaporation during the refueling process, or emissions from imperfectly complete combustion) interacting with emitted NOx.

When burned, ethanol emits less NOx than gasoline.

Unburned ethanol vapor is LESS THAN A TENTH as reactive to NOx as gasoline vapor is.

On top of that, ethanol is cleaner for many other reasons as well:

Gasoline emits smoke, soot, and particulate matter, the cause of, among other things, black roadside snow.  Ethanol emits no SSPM at all.

Gasoline emits sulfur, the cause of acid rain.  Ethanol emits no sulfur.

Gasoline can only prevent gunk by using cancer- and birth-defect-causing aromatics (benzene, toluene, xylene).  Ethanol is inherently gunk-free, needing no such add-ins.

When spilled, oil and its derivatives need chemical dispersants & physical cleanup.  Ethanol is consumed for calories by fauna & dissolves on its own",0

"I'm reflecting more on last Sunday's feast of Christ the King, and wonder if I might provoke some comments. Might have to do it in two sections.
1
First, calling Christ a 'King' is something Jesus said was not of this world. When the people wanted to make him a king after the multiplication of the loaves, he fled from it.  He did preach the 'kingdom of God' where 'God's will be done'.
But by and large our putting a crown on Jesus and drewwing him up like royalty is  a romantic notion taken from faity tales and has not served the Church, or Jesus, well.

Calling Jesus a King is what got Him killed. And it has led to making Popes into Kings and civil Rulers, and Cardinals into 'princes' with all the fancy regalia.

The reality of hereditatary kings running in the family has been mostly a disaster. Even Biblically, only 4 or 5 of the kings were good ones. And same with kings of Europe - most were a disaster and a disgrace. Often the 'heir' had to kill of the rivals, as did Solomon and som",0

That is absurd.

Further, the case decided public libraries have no First Amendment right to display Internet pornography.  Then, after that, and based on that decision, the Court looked at the funding issue.  Based on its first having found no 1A right to such material, it ruled as it did.

So the Court's ruling about the First Amendment applies whether or not federal funding is obtained or not.  Whether or not a public library accepts certain federal funding, there is no First Amendment right to Internet pornography in public libraries.",0

"The issue of loss of Open Spaces in the Denver core is even worse than the article says.  The only reason the negative acres per person is not greater is because of the additions to open space in Stapleton and small increase around Confluence Park area. In the central area the loss is even greater with the closing of many of DPS schools that had park and playground facilities, Gove Middle School for one. Denver leadership has not done anything to improve the number of parks and playgrounds in the core. They need funding and should focus on getting funding, so many missed opportunists, the huge CU redevelopment could have been a place for a new park, but Denver has zero money to buy and build. Aurora and everywhere else has a sales tax to pay for parks, not Denver. The fact Denver clears out on weekends and Jeffco and Boulder OS is packed is evidence that current planning for densification and no cars is not working or going to work unless parks and OS are created close by.",0

So, if they don't buy it back , you'll have to buy very expensive batteries to store the surplus electricity and the batteries only last ten years, the same amount of time it takes to pay off your initial investment. By then (ten years later), you're no further ahead and now you'll need expensive maintenance on your ten year old system.

"Restricting the free flow of lumber into the US is part of the ""swamp"" that President Elect Trump has sworn to drain.  Lumber was an issue when the Canada US Free Trade agreement was negotiated. They didn't want the dispute on lumber to queer the free trade agreement, so they set it aside, with an expectation it would be dealt with later.  What has been happening for decades, is US private timberland owners export valuable logs to Asia and elsewhere, and then as a country, the US makes up that loss of national fiber, by importing cheap Canadian lumber.  The lobby to restrict Canadian lumber is ongoing because it has been successful to its proponents.  Canadian companies now major stakes in US based sawmilling (West Fraser, Interfor and Canfor). They have thus isolated themselves from the impacts of obstacles to US market access.  Interestingly, in spite of the fact they are now a major part of the US lumber industry, they are prohibited from having a voice in this lobby.",0

Belichick and Brady are dangerous because they have worked together for so long that the learned plays the duo has is monstrous. The playbook is fully installed, allowing them to add quirky plays each week.

He single handedly closed down the majority of mental institutions in this country that eventually led to the homeless crisis we experience today.  And, more than any other politician in my lifetime,  he was responsible for destroying a large number of unions that  led to the dismemberment of America's Middle Class.  Reaganomics and his trickle down theory of wealth generation failed to rejuvenate the Middle Class over a long period of time.

 1.) Competition does not ever injure prices. The thought that it makes them go up is just ridiculous.
2.) More taxis benefit the public but also remember that supply and demand is not foreign to transportation. We forget this in the taxi industry and don't see potential for more riders if we can supply more so we limit ourselves. When we don't supply the demand as has happened in anchorage by increased permit values, we see a substantial decrease in market share. If you only have 188 taxis, you will only supply what 188 taxis can do.

I pay my out-of-pocket costs to my limit, and then they pick up everything over and above my out of pocket maximum, just like insurance. The annual coverage limit is $1M per person on my plan.

So lets review. Your plan (if bought through the exchange) for a family of three costs roughly $1250 a month and you have a $10,500 family deductible. So you pay $15,000 in premiums and another $10,500 in an incident. Your total cost for that year is capped at $25,500. That too high for most Americans.

Mine is $5400 in monthly health share costs and $1500 deductible. Max is $6,900. Much more manageable. I guess that is what happens when you remove the profit margin.

"Tita Girl:

Congressional compensation before the ACA consisted of a salary plus federal healthcare. If they switched to the ACA and were required to pay 100% of the new premiums, that would have meant a substantial reduction in their gross compensation. The subsidy they receive is equivalent to the cost to the government of the federal healthcare that previously had been provided to them. The effect of the subsidy is that their gross compensation is equal to what it was before the switch to the ACA. 

As a business owner or board member, I have had several instances where an employee had reason to request that they be allowed to opt out of the company-provided healthcare in order to purchase their own healthcare. We agreed and paid them what the cost of their coverage had been to the company. That was fair. Their compensation remained the same and there was no additional cost to the company.

The President and Min of Defence and Police must specify where such deployments will occur plus other requirements of the Defence Act.
The SANDF may so deploy to the Cape Flats area but will do so based on an SAPS generated plan of operation with  CJOps operational inputs in respect of troop levels and possible tasks.

A weighting of 50% in T-bills & long bonds admittedly might provide downside protection but at what cost?  

I don't disagree with the notion of a permanent portfolio as it speaks to developing a sound investment strategy and sticking with it rather than being driven by panic.   But I think one also needs to be rationale and adapt over time.  For example at one time it made a lot more sense to hold T-bills when they were paying 3 or 4% and upwards of 10 - 12%..  Today they aren't even worth the bother.  There is arguably a stronger case for long bonds, but as mine have matured over the last 10 years I have sought more lucrative options.  If rates normalize I will adapt again - but certainly not at 50% fixed income.",0

For assuredly, I say to you, till heaven and earth pass away, one jot or one tittle will by no means pass from the law till all is fulfilled."" Obviously with the sin and perversion all around us all has not been fulfilled. To the contrary, not only did Jesus uphold the law, but He strengthened it by defining it exactly as God does so, in His repronouncemens regarding adultery and murder. I find it interesting He also supports the prophets as Ezekiel also called attention to the sin of homosexual behavior. So did Paul. In fact, no where in the Bible do you find any support to say homosexuality is not a sin.

This perception is compounded in countries like South Africa and Tanzania, where foreign investors have been accused of looting.

If you are talking about Chatel slavery, the US bishops might have owned slaves--but that was not for lack of a clear condemnation of Chatel slavery. The bishops simply ignored Church teaching. This is not all that different from bishops who give communion to pro-abortion politicians despite clear Church teaching on that issue also.

Trump's and Obama's Executive Orders are fully within the powers exercised by US Presidents for decades.  Each one gets to stomp on those of his predecessor!  Obama did it to Bush; Trump is doing it to Obama!

When Obama exceeded Presidential powers (SCOTUS 9-0 decision in National Labor Relations Board vs. Noel Canning-an attempt to have a NLRB member appointed without Congressional approval.)  I find him to be at fault.  


The Congress' overruling thirteen (13) of Obama's Executive Orders using the Congressional Review Act (5 U.S. Code § 801) was fully authorized by law, as well.   

A law passed by the House of Representatives, the Senate and signed by the President killed each of those Obama Orders.",0

Hurricanes are about water vapour cycle thermodynamics: they are enormous heat engines that pick up energy in the form of latent heat in evaporated water, and then convert it into kinetic and potential energy as the water vapour rises, condenses, and then spreads out at the top of the storm.

It is the enthalpy (i.e., surface temperature) of water, and the rate of evaporation (i.e., wind speed) that matter.

This is what you're here for.....  The headline of the article here is, ""Why the softwood lumber tariff is a gift for investors"". The author explains that ""The duties could have been worse and the U.S. still needs Canadian lumber to feed its recovering housing market."" In the next paragraph, the author tells you that the duties imposed ""average about 20 per cent across the Canadian sector."" So, was the 'reality' as bad as the expectation?

(Mostly what I'm doing here is Copy/Paste from David Berman's article.) He says:
 
""But investors had been bracing themselves for something far more punitive. Earlier this year, at least one industry observer had floated the possibility of an initial tariff as high as 40 per cent, or about double what the U.S. has started with.""

The problem seems to be needs seem to cluster by demographics beyond the school walls.

Were a school with 50% of its students reading below their grade were to ignore that and instead of hiring tutors offered a curriculum heavy on AP classes, they would not be spending money wisely.  Nor would a school with 50% of its students reading above grade level not offer them, be serving their population.

If she were to run, Congresswoman Hanabusa is rumored to have the backing of the Ariyoshi and Team Inouye groups, and some of the unions.

He's suggesting a drop to below 10% Catholic Church attendance by 2030 (which is not actually that far away).

In just 10 years' time nearly all of them will be too frail to attend Mass regularly. Result: empty churches.",0

"W H Auden wrote a poem at the start 0f WWII, ""September 1, 1939"" (the day the Germans invaded Poland). The last two stanzas (which Auden later dropped from the poem) are

All I have is a voice 
To undo the folded lie,
The romantic lie in the brain
Of the sensual man-in-the-street
And the lie of Authority
Whose buildings grope the sky:
There is no such thing as the State
And no one exists alone;
Hunger allows no choice
To the citizen or the police;
We must love one another or die.

Defenceless under the night
Our world in stupor lies;
Yet, dotted everywhere,
Ironic points of light
Flash out wherever the Just
Exchange their messages:
May I, composed like them
Of Eros and of dust,
Beleaguered by the same
Negation and despair,
Show an affirming flame.

""We must love one another or die."" That, to me, is the message of the Gospels.",0

A different view of a different kind of change is seen if we pay attention to what is happening in the Royal Commission hearings in Australia and to some of what is coming out of Ireland - both places where the influence of the institutional/hierarchical church has been decimated.  

The Royal Commission is evoking a thinking that is just stunning while looking into 1) Factors that may have contributed to the occurrence of child sexual abuse at Catholic Church institutions in Australia and 2)  Factors that may have affected the institutional response of Catholic Church authorities in Australia to child sexual abuse.  Why does it take a secular governmental body to get the hierarchy to even think to ask these questions?

Note that in John 8:1-11 the woman is caught in the act of adultery. She is not queried, not given an opportunity to repent, she is dragged off for summary execution ( and a chance to see if Jesus can be trapped). Mercy would require more than that.

In order to snap these folks back to reality, Jesus begins to write in the ground - the assumption being that He is writing the sins of the teachers and Pharisees to shame them.

Once her accusers leave, He has no basis to condemn her - there are no witnesses.

But He doesn't say ""No sweat, adultery is in the eye of the beholder"" or ""try to be more careful so you're not seen when you're cavorting"".

He says ""leave your life of sin"".",0

This is going to become much more of a problem as large companies separate themselves from having a pension fund for their long term employees and if they have, they will probably get rid of the long term employees prematurely so that they can minimize their outlay.
In my opinion the government should set up a savings plan for each employee in such a manner, such that they are guaranteed 70 to 80% of their annual income once they get retired regardless on how long they live.

"As the Minister of Information and Policy and Strategy advisor to the Hawaiian Kingdom I can state unequivocally and with full authority that the ""aquarium industry"" is in violation of one of the basic principles of Hawaiian culture, malama aina.

Malama aina has been a traditional socio-cultural practice of Hawaiians and ALL Polynesian peoples for many many thousands of years. Malama aina roughly translates as ""nurture and sustain what feeds and provides for us"". It means that we must act ethically, sustainably and on a subsistence basis at ALL times whenever we take food or resources from nature,

To do this we take from nature only what we need to sustain ourselves and NOTHING more and we do nothing that might effect the natural balance of all living things.

America was the architect of NATO, and the only time Article 5 was invoked was after the 9/11 attacks on America.  That's why British, German, Dutch, and other contingents joined our attack on, and occupation of, Afghanistan.  There was considerable hope (and anxiety), well-publicized before Trump's address to NATO, that he would simply reaffirm that the United States still stands behind Article 5.

Whoever wrote this article is trying to fool everyone.



In fact, Zinke voting record shows several instances where he's voted yes on bills that turn over federal lands to state and private parties.

The headline and the article are both very misleading.
.

In 2012, Zinke signed Montana Constitutional Governance Pledge to transfer federal lands to the state.

In 2014, Zinke supports a bill by Paul Ryan proposing to pay off the national debt by selling public lands.

Zinke supports a DC written bill that would turn over Montana’s public lands to out-of-state developers and cut access to hunting and fishing.

There are several more instances of Zinke voting to privatize public lands, to sell off public lands, and lock up land.
.

He also claims to be pro-gun, but Montana shooting groups give him a zero rating.

He's not what this article paints him to be.

"Electric vehicle subsidies don't make any sense unless EVs are inherently a superior technology which requires a critical mass of adoption to drive down the costs to the point where the vehicles can complete directly on their own merits. The fact that Ontario is the largest car manufacturing jurisdiction in North America is another factor which needs to be kept in mind, as is the fact that Ontario, Quebec and BC each have surfeit of clean electricity.

As early as 2007 mainstream manufacturers such as VW recognized that “all cars eventually will be electric”, but have been slow to act on that important insight.  The reason that all cars will eventually be electric relates to the fact that electric cars are, as a matter of thermodynamic efficiency, at least 500% more efficient than gas cars, have approximately 99% fewer moving parts in the drive train and cost only about 10% as much as a gas car to power. EV subsidies are helping this new technology to overcome legacy barriers to entry.",0

I am not speculating anything, I referenced numbers from other sources.

Now you can try to argue the number isn't that big if you want but the end point is still that you don't have the right to take away people's ability to defend themselves. Can I make you stop driving because someone else crashes their car? More young children die in backyard pools than by gunshots so why don't you crusade against pools too? 

You suggested that people who protect gun rights are to blame for victim's of gun violence, I am applying your same logic to say that people who want to take away gun rights will then be responsible for those who died because they could not defend themselves.",0

Reagan's all out assault on Collective Bargaining started the fall in middle class standard of living. The good old days of the '50s and '60s were the days when a father could go to work at a union job and make enough to support his family so the wife/mother could stay home and raise the kids. Reagan also is responsible for the massive increase in healthcare costs with his push to deregulate the healthcare industry so that once General/non profit hospitals became enormous profit generating HMOs. Tax cuts for the uber wealthy under the guise of some of that largesse trickling down to us undeserving masses who still pay taxes was the crowning blow.,0
"""Another part of the explanation is easier to discern. The reddest states on that map at the top—Mississippi, Alabama, Louisiana, New Mexico, Maine—have exceptionally high poverty rates and thus receive disproportionately large shares of federal dollars. Through a variety of social programs, the federal government disburses hundreds of billions of dollars each year to maintain a “safety net” intended to help the neediest among us. Consider, for example, the percentage of each state’s residents who get “food stamps” through the federal government’s SNAP program. This chart tells the story."" ...
""As it turns out, it is red states that are overwhelmingly the Welfare Queen States. Yes, that's right. Red States—the ones governed by folks who think government is too big and spending needs to be cut—are a net drain on the economy, taking in more federal spending than they pay out in federal taxes. They talk a good game, but stick Blue States with the bill.""

"True, although young people should be FAR more concerned about the pace of federal SPENDING than tax reform.  It's the spending that determines what they'll have to pay.  Bigger government means more taxation to pay for it, and vise versa. 

The reduction in tax-deferred 401(k) contributions probably makes sense.  It's a form of tax break (actually a tax delay but with some of the same effects). The purpose is to encourage more people to save for retirement. It's a good goal, but like SS it should be capped at a modest level. People with more money can (and do) save beyond that in other accounts that aren't tax-deferred, so there's still ample places to save. Really no need to give that tax break beyond a modest level (although $2400/yr is a little TOO modest, IMO).  Maybe more like $10k/yr.",0

You are right about one thing-the rail is an investment into the future,
 BUT the question is WHO'S Future? The politicians, construction people, and contractors, perhaps. But not we, the people! This rail will never pay for itself, ever! It is already antique and outdated, before it is even finished
This rail was doomed from day 1 because of the way it was planned and handled. Very little sunshine or public input was considered. They had some public meetings, but they were minimal, and difficult to attend, due to scheduling and short notice! Most people are at work during the day, and couldn't get off on such short notice. We never really got to vote on it, or what kind of rail it was going to be. They should have used maglev, but no! The design was all back room deals in secret, for the most part! And WHY did they buy the railcars now, when they are going to sit & rust for 10 Years before they are ever used?THIS rail will NEVER pay for itself. It will always be a $$$$ drain!",0

JUNEAU—Governor Bill Walker today signed into law Senate Bill 91, an historic reform of the state’s criminal justice system. The law advances data-driven, research-based policies to reduce recidivism, enhance public safety and curb corrections spending. 

...

“Today we’re making transformative changes to our criminal justice system,” said Governor Bill Walker. “With SB 91, we’re dropping the practices that we know don’t work to keep communities safe, and expanding the practices that do. I’m proud to join legislative leaders in adopting this reform package.  It reflects a broad consensus among stakeholders and practitioners in Alaska on how to get the most public safety out of the dollars we spend.”

"""It's all in how the research is designed.""

That is absolutely true. I've also designed and conducted research in business when working while I was younger.

While an unethical researcher can design research to arrive at a predetermined outcome, I believe that is relatively rare. I think that most of the problems in research can be attributed to an array of factors such as poor sampling (size, quality, convenience, etc.), question design (what exactly is being measured?), response rates, schedule, cost, experience and so on.

Another issue concerns the consumer of the research. I've seen others in the situation where their results did not conform to the client's (or management's) beliefs. On one or two occasions I've even seen results twisted by the client to conform to those beliefs, even though the data clearly did not support.

I don't agree that all research is suspect. But all research has weaknesses, and it's best to be aware of that and look out for them.",0

"What the mayor, the council, and the legislature refuse to do is ask federal officials to conduct a fair and open review of the rail project’s costs, technology, and even the alignment to determine what can be accomplished with available funding.

I have testified that urban maglev can complete the 20-mile plan within the current $6.8 billion funding. If the legislature approves a two-year surcharge extension, the maglev could even accommodate the east and west extensions of the alignment (i.e., the locally preferred alternative) with an $8 billion budget. Ignoring maglev now would be unethical, continuing the debacle created when a maglev also was ignored in 2008.",0

Amazon used to be great 10 years ago.  Now I will buy from anyone else.  Amazon has become wayyyyy too big, and just undercuts and sells items at a loss until everyone else is out of business.  The fabric of our society is being replaced with these mega-warehouses led by a soul-less weirdo.  They also are anti-publisher, anti-artist, and anti-small business.  When they have it their way, they will control every part of every household goods transaction, and they currently rip off and abuse and harm UPS, USPS, and FedEx and even have aims to put them out of business.  Not a good thing.

Support anyone but amazon.  At least spread your purchases around - so one company with an undeserved ""we're the best"" reputation doesn't get every sale of every item in the whole country.  They need thriving competition, not more 50 acre warehouses.",0

1.  The only dental fluorosis which may be attributable to fluoridated water is mild to very mild, a barely detectable effect which causes no adversity on cosmetics, form, function, or health of teeth.  This level of dental fluorosis is neither ""enamel damage"" nor does it require any treatment whatsoever.

2.  The ""41% of all children"" is a complete misrepresentation of a 2010 CDC study by Beltran-Aguilar in which 41% of adolescents examined showed signs of dental fluorosis.  This consisted of 37.1% with mild dental fluorosis, 3.8% moderate, and negligible severe, with the moderate being attributable  to improper ingestion of toothpaste, and/or exposure to high levels of environmental or well-water fluoride during teeth developing years of 0-8.

Liberal ideas stopped being 'better ideas' a long, long time ago.  Ronald Reagan was a Democrat at one time and switched because, like he said, ""The Democrat Party left me, I didn't leave them.""   John F. Kennedy would be considered a conservative today.  And he was even less  fond of the CIA in his day as Trump is now. Kennedy wanted to break the CIA into a thousand pieces after the failed Bay of Pigs in 1961. He never got over being duped by the CIA.  The power that comes from  the  ability to collect information and use it to extort or  destroy lives has always been a powerful  temptation to those who work in our spy industry. Many decent people have served  and gone, but what of the indecent ones? I think that a good, thorough  house cleaning has been long over-due.",0

"Actually, per QUR'AN, 'taqiyya' is permission to deny being Muslim to save one's life if admitting one's faith will get one killed.  So far Shi'a scholars have, on that basis, ruled that we can't practice taqiyya in the US because, despite the best efforts of hate-mongering nitwits like Dumbitchki it hasn't come to that yet.  For most of us.

Bet you can't even identify the passage in Qur'an where taqiyya was first authorized, because the most vocal revilers of my Book have never bothered to read it.

Once again, you demonstrate the fact that antifluoridationists have no understanding of what constitutes valid evidence.  Donna did not present ""Canadian data"".  She presented her unsubstantiated claim as to what she deems was done by the Ministry of Health, and her own interpretation of what she claims was found in some ""collected data"".  This is nothing but anecdotal personal opinion.  If she desires credibility for her claims she will need to properly cite where this data may be found such that it can be viewed at its original source, verified for accuracy of what she claims, and considered in its proper context.

The information I provided was a direct quote from the McLaren study, which I properly cited.

Antifluoridationists will never understand that they can't just state whatever unsubstantiated claims they wish, and expect that to be accorded credence.

Could he be jealous of nations where theocracies view females as chattel, or second-class citizens ... after he claimed to be a 'feminist'?  Can he understand why many people choose to leave homelands, plagued by over-population, resource depletion, pollution, and heavy-handed centralized authorities, which never consult their weary citizens through plebiscites or elections?

"Gothic architecture, is relatable to contemporary people because like modern architecture, its organic form is visible to the eye. Gothic-era sculptures  possess relatability--not the cool remoteness or aloofness of divinity or sanctity far and away, but the intimacy of a loving parent embracing an infant, or a holy person sharing his goods with the poor. An image of Gislebertus, for example, portrays an angel awakening the Magi, to warn them to return home another way. The worthies share a bed, and are covered with what looks like a great cloak rather than a blanket. A star hovers overhead. And the angel reaches out to them not with a scary trumpet blast (possibly a  heart-attack inducing method) but with the gentlest of touches with a finger.

I don't see in this piece of scripture or any other piece of scripture that Jesus would not forgive her & allow her to return saved to her current relationship.  So what is not clear in the Gospels is what happens after that forgiveness - what is allowed from this point on.  He does not in fact tell this woman to go and sin no more.  Possibly because he realizes her divorce is not curable.  Like a kleptomaniac can't stop stealing, perhaps Jesus realizes she does not have the strength to stop sinning but tells us thru this parable that even chronic sinners can still be forgiven and saved.",0

Since the former is far worse than the latter, I think you have granted prosecutor, judge, and jury the power to inflict more cruelty and pain than would be involved in surgical intervention.  When cancer strikes, the offending tissue is removed.  When hormone producing organs malfunction, they would profitably be removed so that the patient can heal and recover to again fit into society in a productive way.

The ACLU and a group of liberal Democrats, later joined by a few Republicans and Libertarians have been fighting against this since the Patriot Act was passed. The memos shown in the article are a victory for those seeking to expose how poor the FBI's unmasking procedures are. You can google ACLU FBI and unmasking and you can start reading on this.

While they might have payroll of only 120 hours a week, the owners likely work 120 hours or more just between the two of them.   So lets give them credit for 400 hours a month together, 4800 hours a year.

Lets say there is some increase in revenue realized from higher prices, and their net after-tax income only shrinks to $75,000.

Last year they worked 4800 hours and made $100,000, an effective ""wage"" rate of $20.88 an hour for the OWNERS.

Drop their after tax income to $75,000, and their effective ""wage"" rate drops to $15.50 an hour.

They can close up, and take a minimum wage job somewhere with no capital risk and make more money.

Drug development is a risky business at any time. Sometimes the risk doesn't pay off and you lose money. If you are deciding what drug you will develop, knowing how big the market will be if you are successful will be part of the planning process.

Pharma's have to understand that we will not be guilted into paying ransoms.

This is the same logic as why we don't pay ransoms to terrorist groups. Doing so encourages the activity.

Should we feel bad for the people afflicted? Of course. That does not mean that we should pay whatever is asked for these drugs.

My guess is that at $1,000 per year per patient they can still produce it at a profit.  That they may never get their R&D investment back is irrelevant. That money is gone. Any revenue is better than none.",0

Talk to your own doctor on how great the ACA is.  Now talk to your individual paying for these premiums only to have 30-40% increases of premiums from year to year.  That's if there's still even a plan to choose from as I know many carriers have left the states. So this thing about the new plan only helping the rich is not correct.  How about they are trying to help the middle class and the average tax payer that actually pay premiums.   Keep in mind only around 50% pay taxes.

With this said, I do take news with a grain of salt.  This is just a place for local news and sports.",0

"""my military buds are livid and questioning why they are wearing the uniform"".
.
Are you suggesting that your ""military buds"" only want to wear the uniform if the a government that condones and participates in
.
(a) torture of Canadian citizens;
.
(b) indefinite detention without trial of Canadian citizens?
.
If that is why they are wearing the uniform, then, yes, perhaps they should reconsider.
.
From 1939 - 1945, 43,000 Canadians died fighting  against the lawlessness of a totalitarian dictatorship.  Among the lessons of that conflict was that the greatest source of prosperity, security, and liberty of democracies are civil rights.
.
Governments do not have the right to torture people;
to hold people in indefinite detention without trial;
to deny citizens the benefits and protections of the criminal law.
.
Those are the values that the Canadian Army fought for at Dieppe and Ortona, in Normandy, and in Holland.
.
They are the values that the SCC has upheld.

"""I have a theory as to why you (we as men) don't get it.""

The Korn Ferry Hay group did the largest wage study in history, with 8.7M participants in 33 nations, across hundreds of industries.  Canada was in their analysis.  They found that if you did only two things:

a) controlled for employer
b) controlled for job title

The average 'wage gap' in those 33 nations was a minuscule 1.6%.  Every other study stops at the industry (clearly not equal work) or at a government job classification (ballpark but still not equal work) and doesn't go to the actual same employer or job. Once you do, the wage gap effectively vanishes.

So, ""we"" don't get it because this kind of analysis has been done for 30+ years, now, and no reasonable economist thinks the gap is due to workplace discrimination, but 30 years on, it's still getting pitched as discrimination in the media. People are being openly dishonest at this point, and it's not the economists who are the dishonest ones.",0

Trump proves again and again that he favours dictatorial leadership and disdains democracy.  The Republicans seem fine with it and certainly Trump's base base is always delighted.  So it hardly matters a whit that Trump and Putin had a seeming love fest; if we're lucky they can bring some stability the way Obama working with Putin and others did on Iran and nuclear weapons.

But if we lower the cost of maintaining that underclass, we gain.

Currently, we devote considerable resources to a variety of enforcement, emergency response and damage control measures, and at the same time we marginalize the productive potential of this underclass by forcing them underground, and tacitly promote a criminal trade in narcotics.

Part of the reason this narcotics problem has grown is that there will always be a criminal element.  When we drive that criminal out of (for example) the numbers racket, by creating government lotteries and casinos, they look for other lines of business to exploit.  So the hidden challenge in the type of transition being contemplated is in finding a more benign trade for criminal elements to apply themselves to.

President-elect Trump is the final proof and ultimate personification of the concept of white (male) privilege; that is unless you can conceive of a black guy or a Latino being elected President of the United States without one day of public (or military) service of any kind, on any level, at any time.

For nearly a century, individuals in various parts of the Western world have struggled with the question of how, and how much, we should engage politically and personally with governments that we find morally abhorrent.

With the election of Donald Trump—a candidate who has lied his way into power, openly embraced racist discourse and violence, toyed with the idea of jailing his opponents, boasted of his assaults on women and his avoidance of taxes, and denigrated the traditional checks and balances of government—this question has confronted us as urgently as ever.""

Unfortunately for Trump and the GOP, they are far from agreeing on such a program and the electoral base that elected them is shrinking through demographic change.  

Thus, GOP election prospects in two and four years time are at serious risk unless they can show substantial progress on the economic and international fronts.

"No prob - happy to help. I'm doubtful that the firearm seller allowed for the transaction to go through without an NCIC approval #. It's more likely that the government's own systems, the checks and balances within Instacheck/NCIC, were what failed. The firearms dealer doesn't actually 'see' the NCIC report of a purchaser, they only receive a confirmation or denial of purchase  so there's not really anything to judge from their end... In regards to liability, the government is immune from any save for proximate causation which isn't really an argument here. You may be thinking of the Dylan Roof case - where his pending charges in state court should have shown up on his attempt to purchase the firearm that he used, but that one also slipped through the cracks. As a responsible multiple-gun owner myself, it's very sad and very frustrating to see the government fail in its own obligation to not allow prohibited people purchase firearms.

The aggregate of all these observations gives credence that this was perhaps a political motivated ruling.    IMO AG Chin and the governor lacked systems thinking by pursuing this challenge claiming damage to tourism but failed to see the potential political backlash (e.g. loss of federal funds) and the now reported social media boycott of Hawaii, which in all likelihood could impact tourism way more than the AG claimed as a reason to challenge the travel ban.",0

Let us not return to the era of William Jennings Bryan.

By the same logic carrots are ""money"", too.  So is wheat, corn, pork bellies, aluminum ingots, steel ingots, copper, newsprint, cotton, sugar, camels, horses, sheep ...

Gold is a precious metal, and is traded just like many other commodities.  It is a medium of exchange, and a store of value, and so therefore is a form of currency.  But in some societies pigs, goats, cows and sheep are also considered media of exchange and stores of value.

The rate of exchange of any currency reflects the market perception of the relative scarcity of the currency and its ability to hold value (or increase, or indeed decrease, in value).

But every player has to know what they are doing and what their teammates are going to do.

Then, a few years later, they elected a fine leader of the opposition who is not a prime minister in waiting.

After a number of years of Harper conservatism in which we were constantly reminded of our fears, Canada is now invigorated by someone who touches our hunger for a vision.

I agree with what you've written  here.  I'd add this.  It's a terribly dangerous slope to step out onto when we try to judge a matter based on emotion, instead of the law.

Yet, I can't help but wonder how so many who feel this way would feel if it were THEIR lands that were being threatened, by trespassers who felt they had a right to the property.   It's really easy to rely on an emotion response when the law is not on your side. 

Ultimately, we are a nation of law.  The lay may be imperfect, flawed, etc.  It may even be unjust at times.  But if we don't have the law, what DO we have?  History tells us the answer to that question is violence, ""takings by force,"" and the emergence of a powerful few.

"This is almost identical to an argument I put out over a decade ago.    I pointed out to my Democratic friends that  lax enforcement hurt labor and benefited ownership,   Illegal immigration increased the profitability of ownership and has a negative effect of wage pressure that just increases the disparity between ownership and wage earners.  That used to be a Democratic pillar in the private sector before public employee's became the focus.

If either party is serious about regulating foreign workers, then you punish employers who hire those with no documentation.  A wall doesn't touch the  50% of workers who enter the country legally and overstay visa's.

"No.. Rail is an investment in the future.the argument about no change in traffic congestion is flawed because rail opponents dont include passengers traveling by rail. If those passengers were in their cars, the commute time would increase by hours and the traffic congestion would be horrendous.

The argument about high cost of operations and maintenance is also flawed because rail opponents don't include a huge change In tax base from development around rail stations. Opponents wrongly assumed no change in economic growth. Just plain wrong.

The three billion dollar price tag is not a careful estimate of rail costs. Yet opponents keep quoting this figure from a time when even the proposed route was different and the number of rail stations and columns was not known. Furthermore when the actual cost was projected there was a plebesite which rail won.

"Some thoughts on this - throughout the history of the earth, there have been times when an increase in the earth's temperature both precedes and follows an increase in global C02 emissions.  It is about 50/50 really.  When did a 50% record become a scientific absolute?  Did the chicken come first or the egg?  Secondly,  human activity still makes up a minuscule amount of C02 in relation to the amount that is naturally created.  The oceans, when heated, give off an immense amount of C02 and water vapour.  A process called ""out-gassing"" takes hold in a rising temperature environment and that increases both C02 and water vapor in the atmosphere (the latter being the most prevalent green house gas and the hardest to predict).  Thirdly, the guy who created climate models has said, they are great for understanding climate but very poor at predicting climate.  You can't ignore variables like water vapor.  Too many variables make the whole climate discussion a big ""?"".",0
