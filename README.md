# Confidence-Aware Annotation with LLMs  
*A framework for reliable, auditable, semi-automated dataset labeling*

Use agreement, disagreement, and calibrated trust scoring to decide when LLM annotations are safe to keep and when humans should intervene.  

**Interactive Dashboard**: [https://one684proj.onrender.com/](https://one684proj.onrender.com/)

# Overview

Modern LLMs are powerful annotators, yet they remain:

- overconfident  
- inconsistent  
- mismatched with supervised baselines  
- unreliable for sensitive tasks such as fact verification or toxicity detection

This project develops a **trust-aware annotation pipeline** that quantifies when an LLM prediction is likely correct and when it should be reviewed by a human.  
The system turns raw LLM outputs into **calibrated, actionable trust scores** and visualizes them through an interactive dashboard.

# System Architecture

A high-level view of the flow from LLM outputs → feature extraction → trust scoring → dashboard visualization.

# Key Features

### Deterministic LLM annotation  
- JSON schema enforcement  
- Low-temperature decoding  
- Automatic validation and re-querying  

### Supervised baseline for cross-model validation  
- DeBERTa-v3 fine-tuned for each dataset  
- Provides entropy, margins, and confidence features  

### Trust Scorer  
- Logistic regression + isotonic calibration  
- Uses confidence, disagreement, and text features  
- Outputs actionable trust scores for deferral policies  

### Selective annotation policies  
- High Precision  
- High Coverage  
- Balanced F1  

### Interactive dashboard  
- Confidence regions  
- Hard-case explorer  
- Threshold tuning  
- Dataset-level summaries  

---

## Trust Scorer

![Trust Scorer Diagram](pics/trustscore.png)

Feature groups include:

- LLM confidence  
- baseline probabilities  
- cross-model disagreement  
- text-level complexity indicators  

The scorer outputs a calibrated trust score  
`P(correct annotation | features)`  
used to determine whether to **automate** or **defer**.

# Dashboard

![Annotation Explorer](pics/annotation.png)  
![Confidence Regions](pics/confidence.png)  
![Policy Thresholds](pics/policythresh.png)

The dashboard provides:

### **1. Overview Metrics**  
Summaries of accuracy, κ, F1, ECE, and class-level behavior.

### **2. Annotation Explorer**  
Interactive filtering of examples by confidence, agreement, difficulty, and correctness.

### **3. Confidence Regions + Policy Analysis**  
Scatterplots, threshold sliders, and coverage/accuracy tradeoff curves.

# Results

![Selective Annotation Performance](pics/coverage_accuracy_combined.png)

Selective annotation highlights:

- IMDb: nearly full automation with minimal accuracy loss  
- Jigsaw: 97.3 percent accepted accuracy at 77 percent coverage  
- FEVER: trust scoring substantially improves acceptance precision
